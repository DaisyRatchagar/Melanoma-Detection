# 🧬 Melanoma Detection using Machine Learning

This project focuses on detecting melanoma (a type of skin cancer) using machine learning models trained on the **HMNIST 8x8 RGB** dataset. The goal is to classify skin lesions based on image data and evaluate the performance of various classification algorithms.

## 📁 Dataset

- **Name**: HMNIST 8x8 RGB
- **Source**: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kmader/skin-cancer-mnist-ham10000
- **Description**: A CSV file where each row represents an 8x8 RGB image flattened into 192 columns (64 pixels × 3 channels), along with a label for classification.

## 🚀 Models Used

- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Random Forest Classifier
- SVM (Support Vector Machine)
- KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors)

## 🧪 Evaluation Metrics

- Accuracy Score
- Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-score)

## 🧰 Libraries Used

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `scikit-learn`
